## Vault
A *vault* is a project (or workspace) in Obsidian. You can create multiple vaults, each with their own configuration and set of plugins.

## Page
A *page* is the unit of an Obsidian vault, and is simply a text file on your computer's file system. You can view the file for the current page in your computer's file explorer by using "Show in system explorer" - this is accessible from the context menu for each page (click the three vertical dots in the page's title bar), by right clicking a file in the folder view in the left hand pane, or via the command palette (open using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> and search for "system").

## Folder
Just like in your computer's file system, folders are used to arrange files into a hierarchy. When searching, you can create search terms regarding a page's position in its containing folder(s), as well as the attributes and content of the page itself.

## Link

Two kinds of link are possible in Obsidian:
1. A link to another page in the vault - these are surrounded by double square braces - e.g. [[Start here]]
1. A markdown link to a web resource - these first specify the link text in square braces, then the link destination in round brackets, e.g. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)

## Backlink
Backlinks are a feature of Obsidian that help you see the connections between the different parts of your research. For example if you have pages representing concepts, then backlinks will show you all the pages that link to your current page. You can open the backlink pane using the command palette: hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> and type "backlink", then select "Show backlinks pane". The sources of backlinks can be filtered using search syntax. 

## Graph

Once pages have been linked, the links between them can be visualised in a graph, and this can be used to understand how topics group together, and to navigate between pages.
